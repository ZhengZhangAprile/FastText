# FastText

This is a python script for fast text classification. Using CBOW algorithms and tensorflow.


Documents:

fastTest.py is the source code file. I cited some code from the Basic CBOW implementation source code provided by the lecturer.
README.md is this help file.

Run:(you should install the tensorflow)
python fastTest.py    (Linux terminal) (all the data set should be in the same folder with the source code)
